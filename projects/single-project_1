            <h3><li><em>Introduction</em></li></h3>
            <p>My name is Kaylum Walls. I was originally born in a country that is part of the United Kingdom called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales">Wales</a>.
            After a month I was born, my mother decided to move to <a href="https://www.chicago.gov/city/en.html">Chicago, Illinois</a> to be with my father for a new life as a family.
            For the first 15 years of my life, I've moved to many parts of Chicago that hold many **great** places to visit such as:</p>

    <h3><li><em>Present Day</em></li></h3>
      <p>Once I turned 16, my family and I decided to move to <a href="https://www.tampa.gov/">Tampa, Florida</a>.
      It took a while for me to get use to such a big change at first, but eventually I learned
      to get more comfortable. Going through such a big change was a very different experiece for me. Especially how the humidity is in Florida. There 
      are quite a few places that I grown to like with that being:</p>

        </ul>
    <h3 style="background-color:#DC143C;"<em>Work and Achievements</em></h3>
          </ul>
            <p>Perfecting my basketball game and winning tournaments will forever feel like great achievements to me. 
              I've been learning about basketball since I was just a 6 year old watching the <a href="https://www.nba.com/bulls">Chicago Bulls</a> play beautiful basketball to entertain fans such as myself.
              Nearly everyday I work on my basketball skills to not only feel more improved, but feel accomplished for never giving up on something I love doing.
              My goal one day is to have my own gym and to teach many people the skill of basketball.

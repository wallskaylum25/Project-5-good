          of what to expect when starting your journey into software developement, as well as personally getting to know me and what 
          I've accomplished. Not only that, you'll be given a chance to fill out a form for an opportunity to learn more about Correlation One
          and how they can assist you in gaining the skills of a software developer. If you find this introduction to be captivating,

  <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>For the last 3 years I have worked Amazon Warehouse TPA1 and TPA4. I originally work for Stow Inbound but have done many other thing such as Amnesty, Decant, and Pack Singles.
      As time went on I wanted to challenge myself and aim start to pursue a better career. Roughly around 6 months ago, I had grown an interest into software developement
      from wanting to be more involved in the IT originally after doing some research. Through some time browsing throughout
      <a href="https://hiring.amazon.com/#/">Amazon</a> Career Choice, I found that <a href="https://www.correlation-one.com/">
      Correlation One</a> was offering the opportunity to provide the knowledge and skillset
      to create code strings of my own to be more creative in the IT world.

  <h2>Why Join Correlation One?</h2>
    <center><img src="code.webp" width="180"></center>
    <p>Correlation One is a great online program for someone who wants to learn
      about software developement. During the first month, all who join will first
      get familiar with HTML. Through HTML, you'll gain the knowledge on how to 
      get started on making a webpage, such as this one you have visited. There are many things that you can
      do in HTML such as upload images on your webpage, creating text to explain to viewers
      what your page is about, and even decorate your webpage with varies colors for your webpage.
      Not only that, but you can even expect to learn about CSS to make your webpage even more decorative!
      The one thing I find the most interesting from joining Correlation One is the fact that there 
      is always more to learn in this field. One of the reasons for that is because technology is forever changing and 
      we must learn to adapt to what is to come to the software industry.
